## Link to bug demonstration repository
<!--
A demo repository will show the combination of module versions being used,
command-lines and configurations.  NYC is very complex, it is difficult or
even impossible to triage most bugs without this information.

If you cannot share a link to your repository (maybe it's private) then you must
create a basic `nyc-bug-demo` repository and link to that please [mandatory].
